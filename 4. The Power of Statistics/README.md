# The Power of Statistics

## About This Course
This course is part of my completion of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**. In this course, I explored how data professionals use **statistics** to analyze data and extract valuable insights.

## Course Overview
In this course, I explored how data professionals use **statistics** to uncover meaningful insights. I studied key statistical concepts including **descriptive and inferential statistics, probability, sampling methods, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing**. Through hands-on activity labs guided by Google experts, I:  

- Summarized datasets using **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, variance, etc.).  
- Modeled data with **probability distributions** (normal, binomial, Poisson).  
- Applied **sampling methods** to ensure representative data collection.  
- Constructed **confidence intervals** and conducted hypothesis tests (**t-tests, z-tests**).  
- Used **Python** for statistical analysis and data exploration.  
- Communicated statistical findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.  

Google employees provided real-world examples and practical exercises to reinforce these concepts, helping me build a strong foundation in statistical analysis for data-driven decision-making.  

## Key Learnings
By completing this course, I:
- Explored how **statistics** is used in data science.
- Applied **descriptive and inferential statistics** to summarize and analyze data.
- Computed **probabilities** using fundamental rules.
- Modeled data with **probability distributions**.
- Evaluated different **sampling methods** and their applications.
- Computed **sampling distributions**.
- Constructed and interpreted **confidence intervals**.
- Performed **hypothesis testing** to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- Python scripts demonstrating **statistical analysis** techniques.
