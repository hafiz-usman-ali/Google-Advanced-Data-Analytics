# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights  

## About This course  
This repository showcases my work for the **Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights** course (Course 3 of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**). Here, I combined Python’s analytical power with advanced visualization tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to transform raw data into compelling narratives. My focus was on storytelling, exploratory analysis, and creating interactive visualizations that drive decision-making.  

Google employees who currently work in the field provided valuable guidance, hands-on activities, and real-world examples, helping me enhance my data analytics and communication skills.

## Course Overview  
In this course, I learned to bridge technical analysis with stakeholder communication. Guided by Google data professionals, I:  
- Cleaned and validated datasets using Python.  
- Practiced **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover hidden patterns.  
- Designed **interactive visualizations** with Plotly and **static dashboards** with Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
- Translated findings into actionable insights using Tableau and Python’s visualization ecosystem.  

## Key Learnings  
By completing this course, I:  
- **Automated data cleaning** with `pandas` and `NumPy`, handling missing values and outliers.  
- **Transformed categorical data** into numerical formats for machine learning readiness.  
- **Built dynamic visualizations** using Plotly for interactive stakeholder reports.  
- **Crafted publication-quality charts** with Seaborn and Matplotlib to highlight trends.  
- **Validated datasets** programmatically to ensure integrity.  
- **Designed Tableau dashboards** for non-technical audiences.  

## My Work  
This repository includes projects where I:  
- Developed **Python scripts** to clean and structure raw data.  
- Used **Seaborn** for statistical visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, distribution plots).  
- Built **Matplotlib** workflows for automated report generation.  
- Documented my approach to resolving data quality issues (e.g., outliers, date formatting).  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Python**: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`  
- **Tableau**: Dashboard design, stakeholder reporting  
- **Data Cleaning**: Outlier detection, categorical encoding, datetime manipulation  
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots (Plotly), statistical charts (Seaborn), exploratory analysis (Matplotlib)
