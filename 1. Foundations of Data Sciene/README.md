# Foundations of Data Science

## About This Course
This course is part of my completion of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**. It covers the foundational concepts of data science and analytics, preparing me for advanced roles such as an entry-level data scientist or an advanced-level data analyst.

## Course Overview
In this course, I explored the role of data professionals in the workplace and learned how they analyze data and structure data projects using the PACE workflow (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) to make better businesses decisions.

The course provided hands-on activities and insights from Google data professionals helping me build foundational skills in data analytics and prepare for advanced roles like data scientist or data analyst.

One of the key concepts I studied was the **PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) workflow** which helps in organizing and managing data projects efficiently. The course also introduced me to industry-standard tools and best practices used by data professionals.
