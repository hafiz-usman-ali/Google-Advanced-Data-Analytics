# 📊 Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships  

## 📝 About This Course 
This repository showcases my work for Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships, the fifth course in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Here, I mastered techniques like linear regression, ANOVA, ANOVA post hoc tests, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, One-way ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA, linear regression, multiple regression and logistic regression (binomial, multinomial, ordinal, and Poisson) to model relationships in datasets and solve real-world business problems. Using Python, I learned to simplify complex data patterns into actionable insights. 

Through hands-on activities, I practiced modeling data and applying key statistical methods. This course enhanced my ability to build and interpret predictive models, strengthening my skills in data-driven decision-making. 

## 📂 Repository Overview  
This repository contains my projects, executive summary, and presentations from the course, showcasing my ability to apply regression analysis effectively. I explored how data professionals use regression models to identify key drivers of business outcomes. Guided by Google experts, I:

- 📌 **Analyzed correlations** between variables to guide model selection.
- 📌 **Built linear regression models** to predict continuous outcomes (sales, user engagement).
- 📌 **Conducted ANOVA tests** to compare group means in experimental designs.
- 📌 **Developed logistic regression models** (binomial, multinomial, ordinal).
- 📌 **Practiced communicating model** results to stakeholders.
- 📌 **Python scripts** for implementing regression models.  
- 📌 **Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks** highlighting data relationships.  
- 📌 **Documentation** of my approach to model evaluation and interpretation.  

## 🎓 Skills Acquired     
✅ **Modeled relationships** between variables using `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`.  
✅ **Interpreted regression coefficients** to identify impactful predictors.  
✅ **Evaluated model fit** with metrics like R-squared, AIC, and confusion matrices.  
✅ **Designed A/B tests** using one-way and two-way ANOVA.  
✅ **Built logistic regressions** for categorical outcomes (e.g., customer churn, product preferences).  
✅ **Visualized results** with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to highlight trends.  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Python**: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`  
- **Regression Techniques**: Linear, logistic (binomial/multinomial/ordinal), Poisson regression  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: ANOVA, F-tests, p-value interpretation  
- **Visualization**: Regression plots, residual analysis, correlation matrices
