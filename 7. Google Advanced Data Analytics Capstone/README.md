# üìä Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone  

## üèÜ About This Project  
This repository contains my **capstone project** for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, where I synthesized skills from all six preceding courses to solve a complex business problem. Guided by Google experts, I applied **data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data storytelling** skills to solve a real-world business problem and to deliver actionable insights, while also refining my professional portfolio and resume for data science roles.  

I worked on hands-on activities that simulated industry-relevant tasks, reinforcing my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and communicate them effectively.  

## üéØ What I Accomplished   
Throughout this course, I:    
- Created and refined my **resume** and **professional portfolio** to showcase my skills.
- **Defining the problem** and structuring it using the **PACE workflow** (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute).  
- **Developing a data frame** to guide analysis and hypothesis testing.  
- Applied **data visualization techniques** to present insights clearly.
- **Analyzing data** with statistical methods and Python libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.  
- **Building and evaluating regression models** to identify key drivers of business outcomes.  
- **Implementing machine learning** techniques for prediction and classification.  
- **Communicating results** through visualizations and stakeholder-ready reports. 
- Implemented **machine learning techniques in Python** to solve complex problems. 

## üöÄ Key Takeaways  
This capstone project solidified my ability to:  
- Apply **end-to-end data analysis** to real-world scenarios.  
- Use **Python, statistics, and machine learning** for data-driven decision-making.  
- Present insights effectively through **visual storytelling**.  
- Demonstrate my expertise in **advanced data analytics** for professional growth.  

With this course, I have completed the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, equipping me with the skills needed for **data science and analytics roles**. üéâ  

## Process  
1. **Problem Framing**: Identified business goals and defined success metrics.  
2. **Data Preparation**: Engineered features, handled missing data, and normalized datasets.  
3. **Model Development**: Iterated through regression and machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
4. **Insight Delivery**: Designed dashboards and presentations to communicate findings to stakeholders.

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Python**: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `statsmodels`  
- **Visualization**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`  
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis  
- **Machine Learning**: Random forests, gradient boosting, model evaluation (ROC/AUC, precision_score, accuracy_score, recall_score, F1-score, etc.)
