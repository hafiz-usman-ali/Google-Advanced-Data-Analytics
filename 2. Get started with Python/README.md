# Get Started with Python

## About This Course
This Course is part of my completion of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**. In this course, I learned the foundational concepts of Python programming and how data professionals use Python for data analysis and problem-solving.

## Course Overview
Throughout this course, I explored the **Python programming language** as a powerful tool for data analysis. I gained hands-on experience with key programming concepts, including:
- Object-oriented programming
- Variables and data types
- Functions and conditional statements
- Loops and iteration
- Data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

Google employees who currently work in the field provided guidance through hands-on activities and real-world examples. Their insights helped me understand how Python is used in data science and analytics.

## Key Learnings
By completing this course, I:
- Defined what a programming language is and why Python is widely used in data science.
- Created Python scripts to display data and perform operations.
- Controlled program flow using conditions and functions.
- Used different types of loops for repeated operations.
- Identified and worked with various data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Manipulated data structures including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Imported and utilized popular Python libraries such as **NumPy** and **pandas**.

## My Work
